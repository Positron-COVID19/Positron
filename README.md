# Positron
*Welcome to the Positron project!*

It is the nature of the human to be surrounded by chaos. This conflict guides our actions and consumes the most valuable resource we have, which is time. It is not strange that circumstances force us to focus on the negative of our lives. 

Our purpose of existing is to feed people with positive news and keep them balanced with all the problems of the world. 
We understand the importance of being aware of your surroundings, but we highlight the need to keep a balance between the good and the bad. 

This project is our attempt to generate a definition for what it means to be positive.
