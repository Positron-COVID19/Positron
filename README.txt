Hello friends, 

I will be using this repository to show you the progress of the navigation bar. 

Update 1 (08/05/2020): 
    We have started using Bootstrap for this project. We have space for all the tabs we have discussed and could potentially add more. There is also space for the search bar. Thanks to Bootstrap the navbar is responsive which mean that when the window is shortened, the navbar will put some links in a Hamburguer menu.
    Unfortunately, there is an issue with the functionality of a dropdown menu. It sees that we are missing some JavaScript files from Bootstrap.
